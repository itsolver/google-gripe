# google-gripe

**Delete all the files you own in Google Drive.** For anyone who is sick of official support lying about “working on it.”

# Use

**You *will* need to set up an environment and modify the source for this program to work.** The complete instructions and code have deliberately been left out. Make sure you understand the full consequences before running this, and that you have backups of anything you want to keep.

## Features

- **Does not trash files**
- Removes the biggest files first, to improve the quota ASAP
- Rather verbose
